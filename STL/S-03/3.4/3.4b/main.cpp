/**
 * Efficiency of deque vs. vector:
 *
 * . When performing a large number of push_back() calls, use
 *   vector::reserve().
 * 
 * . When performing many de-allocations, deque takes longer to
 *   reclaim memory than vector since it is allocated using multiple
 *   "chunks."
 * 
 * . When using insert() or pop_front() with a deque is more efficient
 *   than vector.
 * 
 * . For element access, vector::at() or vector[] is better than
 *   deque's at() or deque[] methods.
 *
 * Here is another deque example that uses dequeâ€™s random access
 * iterators.
