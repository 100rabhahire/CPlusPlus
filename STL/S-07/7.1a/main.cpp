/**
 * Container adaptors are classes that are based on other classes to
 * implement a new functionality, often a more limited one. For
 * example, stack restricts vector and queue restricts deque.
 * 
 * Member functions can be added or hidden or can be combined to
 * achieve new functionality.
 * 
 * Adaptor containers change ordinary containers such as vector,
 * deque, and list into stack and queue, by ¡®adapting¡¯ them to reflect
 * a user¡¯s expectations (i.e., limiting what their underlying
 * container can do).
 *
 * An adaptor allows the standard algorithms to be used on a subset or
 * to modify the data without having to copy the data elements into a
 * new container.
